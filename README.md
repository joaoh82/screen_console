# Screen Console Logging Tool for Godot

Screen Console is a logging tool made for Godot 4 that allows you to print messages to the screen for debugging and development purposes.

It was developed as part of the development of the Kitchen Madness game, but I decided to make the tool open source since I believe that other may have the same issue.

## Requirements:

* Godot 4.0 +

## How to Setup?

1. Create the `addons/` folder if you do not already have one.
2. Clone or copy the Screen Console project folder to the `addons/` folder.
3. Open `Project Settings` and go to the `Plugins` Tab.
4. Enable the `Screen Console` plugin by clicking the checkbox.
5. Go to the `Autoload` Tab
7. Click the button to set the path navigate to `addons/screen_console/screen_console.gd`.
8. Set the `Node Name` to `SConsole` and click `Add`

Done!

## Properties

### Debug Enabled
Enables/Disable logging with the Screen Console tool. This makes it so you don't really have to delete or comment it out the `SConsole.print()` in your code.

If disabled than nothing will be printed.

### Messages Buffer:
Number of maximum number of messages printed to the screen at one time. 

If it goes over that, print commands will be ignores until messages on screen are lower than buffer again.

### Timeout:
Time messages will stay on screen in seconds.

After that messages will be automatically deleted.

### Show Timestamp
If enabled a current timestamp will appear next to the log message.

### Vertical Space:
Vertical spacing between messages. Bigger fonts may need bigger vertical spacing.

### Font Color:
Well, pretty self explanatory.

### Background Color:
Color for the background layer. So it is easier to see the logs on screen.

### Font Size:
Well, pretty self explanatory.

### Anchor (Disabled until I fix a bug):
Where on the screen you would like the messages to be anchored to.

* Top-Left
* Top-Right
* Bottom-Left
* Bottom-Right


## How to use it?

To print messages to screen all you need to do is:
```gdscript
SConsole.print("Hello Screen Console!)
```

That is all!
